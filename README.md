# Linear Algebra Project

This project contains a collection of Python scripts that implement fundamental linear algebra operations using both pure Python and NumPy. The objective of this project is to understand vectors, matrices, slicing, broadcasting, and matrix operations without relying on advanced external libraries except where explicitly allowed.

The project follows strict requirements regarding coding style, documentation, execution, and environment compatibility.
